First you'll need to find a cash register and equip it. Equipping it will make your shop active. You MUST be logged on to run a shop. Items in your inventory and gold will be handled by your shop.

Here are the commands to set your shop up

/shop sell Long Sword x50    (sells a long sword for 50 gold)
/shop buy Long Sword x10     (buys a long sword for 10 gold)
/shop list                   (lists everything in your shop)
/shop remove Long Sword      (removes the listed item from your buy and sell list)
